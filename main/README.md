Run Tracker is an Android application designed to help you monitor your running sessions by tracking real-time location, speed, and elapsed time. The app provides an intuitive user interface and several useful features to enhance your running experience.

## Features

- **Location Tracking:**  
  Utilizes the device's GPS to display current latitude and longitude.

- **Speed Measurement:**

  A built-in timer that displays the elapsed time since the session started or was last reset.

- **User Controls:**
  - **Reset Button:** Resets the timer, UI elements, and font size to their default settings.
  - **Unit Toggle Button:** Switches the speed display between mph and m/s.
  - **Pause/Resume Button:** Allows you to pause and resume both the timer and location updates.
  - **Font Size Adjustment:** A seek bar to dynamically adjust the font size of the speed display.
